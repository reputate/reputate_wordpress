== Description ==

Controlling your Marketing and Reputation can mean the difference between a successful business and a failed difference. Reputate will make sure you're on top of it, automatically.

Marketing is hard and tedius, yet core to improving the sales of your E-Commerce store.

Effective Marketing isn't just about the content, but about the timing. 

That can, and often does, mean the difference between a customer who would've been devoted but never gave your business as econd thought or the customer who was looking to place another order but wasn't thinking about your business. 

Here's some quick information:

*   A loyal customer has around a 60-70% conversion rate
*   In an Adobe study they found that loyal customers who have purchased from you twice before are 9 times more likely to convert than first time customers
*   70% of customers consult reviews or ratings before making a final purchase
*   As many as 79% of consumers trust product reviews as much as a personal recommendation
*   On average, 75 percent of reviews posted on review websites are positive, and 71 percent of consumers agreed that reviews make them more comfortable that they are purchasing the right product or service

Reputate's core vision is to help you focus on what you do best. 

We do that by automatically and in a timely fashion reach out to your customers and help you build the reputation of your company, helping you to convert more first time customers into loyal customers and boost your reputation.

You're completely in charge customizing the look, feel, content and timing of the messages that are sent out.

This plugin connects your WooCommerce store into the Reputate Product. You'll need an API Key generated from your Reputate Dashboard in order to make it work.
